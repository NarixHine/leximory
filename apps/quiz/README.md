# 猫谜

*陪你一起解开英语之谜*

---

Learning English shouldn't feel like drowning in flashcards or grinding through textbooks. We believe that language is best acquired when you're actually doing something with it—when you're curious, engaged, and maybe even a little competitive.

That's why we built 猫谜.

## The idea is simple

You take quizzes. Not the boring, multiple-choice kind you suffered through in school, but thoughtfully crafted exercises that make you think. Fill in the missing words. Unscramble grammar. Parse through a passage and answer questions that require real comprehension. Each quiz (we call them "papers") is a small puzzle waiting to be solved.

And here's where it gets interesting: you're not alone. Every paper has a leaderboard. Submit your answers, and you'll see where you stand against everyone else who's tackled the same challenge. There's something motivating about seeing your name climb that list—or about chasing down the person who's one spot above you.

## What happens when you get stuck

We've all been there. You're reading along, doing great, and then a word appears that you've never seen before. In most apps, you'd have to leave, look it up somewhere else, and lose your flow.

Not here. Select any word and hit "Define." You'll get a proper annotation: what the word means, where it comes from, and other words that share the same root. It's like having a thoughtful dictionary built right into the quiz. And if you want to remember that word for later? Save it to your 生词本 (your personal vocabulary notebook) with one tap.

## For the things you want to revisit

Sometimes you'll encounter a sentence or a question that you just need to come back to. Maybe you got it wrong and want to understand why. Maybe the phrasing was beautiful and you want to remember it. That's what "Mark for Later" is for—a simple way to flag anything that deserves a second look.

## How it works in practice

Browse the papers on the home page. The pinned ones are good starting points if you're new. Pick one that catches your eye and start working through it at your own pace. When you're done, submit your answers.

After submission, the real learning begins. Review what you got right and what you missed. Ask questions about specific answers—the app can explain the reasoning. Look up unfamiliar words. Save the ones worth keeping. Then move on to the next paper, or try to beat your previous score.

The navigation is minimal by design. Home takes you back to the paper list. 生词本 is where your saved vocabulary lives. And there's always a link back to Leximory if you want to explore the broader platform.

We hope 猫谜 becomes your companion in this journey. Language learning is a long road, but it doesn't have to be a lonely or tedious one. Find a paper that interests you, solve a puzzle, learn something new.

That's all there is to it.
