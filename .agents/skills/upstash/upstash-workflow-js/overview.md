# Upstash Workflow SDK

## Quick Start

The Upstash Workflow SDK lets you expose serverless workflow endpoints and run them reliably using QStash under the hood.

Install:

```bash
npm install @upstash/workflow
```

Define a simple workflow endpoint:

```ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow";

export const { POST } = serve(async (context) => {
  await context.run("step-1", () => console.log("step 1"));
  await context.run("step-2", () => console.log("step 2"));
});
```

Trigger it from your backend:

```ts
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";

const client = new Client({ token: process.env.QSTASH_TOKEN! });
await client.trigger({ url: "https://your-app.com/api/workflow" });
```
