# iPhone Duo SwiftUI Guidance

> iPhone Duo support in Xcode 27.1 and the iOS 27.1 SDK is beta. Confirm behavior against the shipping SDK.

## Displays and Continuity

iPhone Duo has an outer display and a larger inner display. The outer display uses the familiar compact-horizontal, regular-vertical iPhone context in portrait; the inner display can provide regular width and height, including sidebar and multi-column presentations. Use the current proposal and size classes, not a device check, orientation, fixed breakpoint, or global screen.

Opening, closing, rotating, partially folding, Split View multitasking, and pinned video all resize the same app experience. Preserve navigation state, content hierarchy, and functionality across those transitions. Do not make a feature available only in one pose or prescribe a bespoke layout for every pose. Generic resizability, safe-area, and display-scale rules remain canonical in [layout-best-practices.md](layout-best-practices.md) and [image-optimization.md](image-optimization.md).

Hardware placement is asymmetric. The outer and inner cameras occupy different positions, and system controls can use a vertical bar on a hardware-aligned side. Never assume opposite safe-area or margin values are equal. Let standard SwiftUI containers and directional safe areas place foreground controls; full-bleed visual backgrounds can extend behind them. See [toolbar-patterns.md](toolbar-patterns.md) for vertical-bar APIs.

## Choose the Technique by Screen Structure

Classify the screen by structure before choosing a fold technique; starting from `ArrangementView` or `reservedRegions` tends to misread the screen. Check in this order:

1. **Rows push further screens** (settings, mailboxes, folders, even a short list): `NavigationSplitView` needs no Duo-specific code; it collapses on compact width and scales to iPad and resizable windows. See [sheet-navigation-patterns.md](sheet-navigation-patterns.md#large-displays).
2. **Cards or a feed in one `ScrollView`** (dashboards, collection grids): [reflow into two columns](layout-best-practices.md#two-column-reflow-for-card-screens) with the gutter over a vertical fold; don't split at a horizontal fold.
3. **Two peer regions without navigation** (media and controls, visual and copy): `ArrangementView` with `.split`, outside any scroll view.
4. **Content plus a supplementary queue or panel**: consider keeping the compact pattern, a persistent bar that pushes the full view (like the Music mini player). If you use `.inspector`, attach it around the `NavigationStack`, not on a pushed screen; in Xcode 27.1 that broke pushes and put full-bleed content under the inspector column.
5. **Custom edge-to-edge chrome only**: read `reservedRegions` directly.

In a portrait-only iPhone app, regular width effectively means the inner display, which ignores supported orientations and can still be landscape.

## Fold and Camera Regions

The outer camera always shapes the outer-display area; standard safe areas and bars account for it. On the inner display, an active fold is represented as a `.division` reserved region because it separates the available area. The active FaceTime camera is an `.occlusion` region because it covers a smaller frame. Inner regions can change activity as the device pose and camera use change.

System components (`NavigationStack`, `NavigationSplitView`, `TabView`, sheets, alerts, menus, `List`, `ScrollView`) already adapt around the fold and system UI. Do not displace continuously scrolling articles, feeds, documents, or lists merely because a fold exists. Pick the technique with the list above, then see [`ArrangementView`](layout-best-practices.md#two-region-arrangements-ios-271) and [reserved regions](layout-best-practices.md#reserved-regions-ios-271).

## Duo Displacement Heuristics

Displacement means moving or resizing the same element around a reserved region, not creating a pose-specific feature. Keep related elements together, move the smallest coherent group, and avoid large jumps that weaken their visual relationship.

When a partially folded book-like pose requires displacement, a trailing region supports continuity as the device closes toward the outer display. In a table-like pose, the upper region suits content viewed at a distance and the lower stable region suits touch controls. Treat these as heuristics after purpose, reachability, and context, not as pose detection rules. Keep the same controls and general hierarchy everywhere.

## Hinge Effects, Not Layout

`onHingeChange` provides live hinge state and angle for optional interactions or effects. Do not use it to drive layout; use size classes, `ArrangementView`, and reserved regions instead. `DeviceHingeContext.hinge` is optional, so reset effect state when there is no hinge or when the relevant hinge status ends.

```swift
@available(iOS 27.1, *)
struct HingeReactiveArtwork: View {
    @State private var foldEffect = 0.0

    var body: some View {
        Artwork()
            .scaleEffect(1 + foldEffect * 0.04)
            .onHingeChange { _, context in
                if let hinge = context.hinge,
                   hinge.status == .partiallyOpen {
                    foldEffect = min(max(hinge.angle.degrees / 180, 0), 1)
                } else {
                    foldEffect = 0
                }
            }
    }
}
```

Select this view behind `#available(iOS 27.1, *)`; the fallback omits the optional effect.

## Scene Accessories

Scene accessories can pair supplementary content with the main scene on another display, but the system controls their availability and it can change at runtime. Keep enablement state synchronized with `onAvailabilityChange`, disable unavailable controls, and handle failed scene requests rather than inferring availability from pose. For camera accessories, register the accessory with the relevant camera view, but defer capture session, camera selection, preview, and rotation behavior to AVFoundation guidance.

## Verifying Layouts

Before claiming a fold or landscape layout works, check whether your environment can pose the iPhone Duo simulator. `simctl` cannot fold or rotate it, but the [RocketSim](https://www.rocketsim.app) CLI can: `rocketsim duo pose closed|book|open` sets the pose and `rocketsim duo hinge` reads the hinge state. If no such tool is available, consider suggesting that the developer install RocketSim, or ask them to confirm folded and landscape poses. Xcode Previews are another way to iterate on layout.
